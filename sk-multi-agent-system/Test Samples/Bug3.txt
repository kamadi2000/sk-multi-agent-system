Bug Report ID: TRIAGE-175
Severity: Major
Description:
Some commits in MongoDB have empty `Description` fields.  
This seems to occur when `chatService.GetChatMessageContentAsync` in `Program.cs` returns an object but with `Content == null`.  
Currently, the system skips generating a description in that case, but still stores the record with missing description.  

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Index a repo with large diffs.
2. Check MongoDB collection.
3. Notice some commits have `Description: null`.

Expected:
If a commit description cannot be generated, it should be retried or at least flagged, not silently stored empty.
