Bug Report ID: TRIAGE-134
Severity: Medium
Description:
When using the `SemanticSearchCommits` function in `GitPlugin.cs`, the results are too vague and sometimes irrelevant.  
Even when searching for "MongoDB connection string", unrelated commits are shown.  
It seems like the relevance threshold (`result.Score < 0.5`) is too low, allowing weak matches.  

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run a semantic search query "MongoDB connection string".
2. Review the top 5 results.
3. Many commits unrelated to MongoDB are included.

Expected:
Semantic search should prioritize highly relevant commits, possibly with a higher relevance cutoff.
